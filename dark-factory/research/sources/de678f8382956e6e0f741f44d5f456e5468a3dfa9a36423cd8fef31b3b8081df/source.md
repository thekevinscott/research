# SWE-agent

SWE-agent takes a GitHub issue and tries to automatically fix it, using your LM of choice. It can also be employed for offensive cybersecurity or competitive coding challenges. [NeurIPS 2024]

Warning
Most of our current development effort is on
mini-swe-agent
,
which has superseded SWE-agent. It matches the performance performance of SWE-agent, while being
much simpler.
See the
FAQ
for more details about the differences.
Our general recommendation is to use mini-SWE-agent instead of SWE-agent going forward.
SWE-agent enables your language model of choice (e.g. GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet 4) to autonomously use tools to
fix issues in real GitHub repositories
,
find cybersecurity vulnerabilities
, or
perform any custom task
.
✅
State of the art
on SWE-bench among open-source projects
✅
Free-flowing & generalizable
: Leaves maximal agency to the LM
✅
Configurable & fully documented
: Governed by a single
yaml
file
✅
Made for research
: Simple & hackable by design
SWE-agent is built and maintained by researchers from Princeton University and Stanford University.
