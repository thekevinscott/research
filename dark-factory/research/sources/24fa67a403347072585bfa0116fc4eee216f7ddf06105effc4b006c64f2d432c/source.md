Proudly made with ClickHouse open source database
Langfuse is an
open source LLM engineering
platform. It helps teams collaboratively
develop, monitor, evaluate,
and
debug
AI applications. Langfuse can be
self-hosted in minutes
and is
battle-tested
.
✨ Core Features
LLM Application Observability
: Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse, thereby tracking LLM calls and other relevant logic in your app such as retrieval, embedding, or agent actions. Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions. Try the interactive
demo
to see this in action.
Prompt Management
helps you centrally manage, version control, and collaboratively iterate on your prompts. Thanks to strong caching on server and client side, you can iterate on prompts without adding latency to your application.
Evaluations
are key to the LLM application development workflow, and Langfuse adapts to your needs. It supports LLM-as-a-judge, user feedback collection, manual labeling, and custom evaluation pipelines via APIs/SDKs.
Datasets
enable test sets and benchmarks for evaluating your LLM application. They support continuous improvement, pre-deployment testing, structured experiments, flexible evaluation, and seamless integration with frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex.
LLM Playground
is a tool for testing and iterating on your prompts and model configurations, shortening the feedback loop and accelerating development. When you see a bad result in tracing, you can directly jump to the playground to iterate on it.
Comprehensive API
: Langfuse is frequently used to power bespoke LLMOps workflows while using the building blocks provided by Langfuse via the API. OpenAPI spec, Postman collection, and typed SDKs for Python, JS/TS are available.
📦 Deploy Langfuse
Langfuse Cloud
Managed deployment by the Langfuse team, generous free-tier, no credit card required.
Self-Host Langfuse
Run Langfuse on your own infrastructure:
Local (docker compose)
: Run Langfuse on your own machine in 5 minutes using Docker Compose.
#
Get a copy of the latest Langfuse repository
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git
cd

🚀 Quickstart
Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse, thereby tracking LLM calls and other relevant logic in your app such as retrieval, embedding, or agent actions. Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions.
1️⃣ Create new project
Create Langfuse account
or
self-host
Create a new project
Create new API credentials in the project settings
2️⃣ Log your first LLM call
The
@observe()
decorator
makes it easy to trace any Python LLM application. In this quickstart we also use the Langfuse
OpenAI integration
to automatically capture all model parameters.
Tip

🔒 Security & Privacy
We take data security and privacy seriously. Please refer to our
Security and Privacy
page for more information.
Telemetry
By default, Langfuse automatically reports basic usage statistics of self-hosted instances to a centralized server (PostHog).
This helps us to:
Understand how Langfuse is used and improve the most relevant features.
Track overall usage for internal and external (e.g. fundraising) reporting.
The telemetry does not include raw traces, prompts, observations, scores, or dataset contents. We document the exact fields that are collected, where they are sent, and the implementation reference in our
telemetry docs
.
For Langfuse OSS, you can opt out by setting
TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
.
