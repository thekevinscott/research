👋 Human Quickstart
1. Create environment and install Browser-Use with
uv
(Python>=3.11):
uv init
&&
uv add browser-use
&&
uv sync
#
uvx browser-use install # Run if you don't have Chromium installed
2. [Optional] Get your API key from
Browser Use Cloud
:
# .env
BROWSER_USE_API_KEY=your-key
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
3. Run your first agent:
from
browser_use
import
Agent
,
Browser
,
ChatBrowserUse
# from browser_use import ChatGoogle # ChatGoogle(model='gemini-3-flash-preview')
# from browser_use import ChatAnthropic # ChatAnthropic(model='claude-sonnet-4-6')
import
asyncio
async
def
main
():
browser
=
Browser
(
# use_cloud=True, # Use a stealth browser on Browser Use Cloud
)
agent
=
Agent
(
task
=
"Find the number of stars of the browser-use repo"
,
llm
=
ChatBrowserUse
(),
# llm=ChatGoogle(model='gemini-3-flash-preview'),
# llm=ChatAnthropic(model='claude-sonnet-4-6'),
browser
=
browser
,
 )
await
agent
.
run
()
if
__name__
==
"__main__"
:
asyncio
.
run
(
main
())

Open Source vs Cloud
We benchmark Browser Use across 100 real-world browser tasks. Full benchmark is open source:
browser-use/benchmark
.
Use the Open-Source Agent
You need
custom tools
or deep code-level integration
We recommend pairing with our
cloud browsers
for leading stealth, proxy rotation, and scaling
Or self-host the open-source agent fully on your own machines
Use the
Fully-Hosted Cloud Agent
(recommended)
Much more powerful agent for complex tasks (see plot above)
Easiest way to start and scale
Best stealth with proxy rotation and captcha solving
1000+ integrations (Gmail, Slack, Notion, and more)
Persistent filesystem and memory
Demos
📋 Form-Filling
Task = "Fill in this job application with my resume and information."
Example code ↗
🍎 Grocery-Shopping
Task = "Put this list of items into my instacart."
grocery-use-large.mp4

💻 Personal-Assistant.
Task = "Help me find parts for a custom PC."

🚀 Template Quickstart
Want to get started even faster?
Generate a ready-to-run template:
uvx browser-use init --template default
This creates a
browser_use_default.py
file with a working example. Available templates:
default
- Minimal setup to get started quickly
advanced
- All configuration options with detailed comments
tools
- Examples of custom tools and extending the agent
You can also specify a custom output path:
uvx browser-use init --template default --output my_agent.py
💻 CLI
Fast, persistent browser automation from the command line:
browser-use open https://example.com
#
Navigate to URL
browser-use state
#
See clickable elements
browser-use click 5
#
Click element by index
browser-use
type
"
Hello
"
#
Type text
browser-use screenshot page.png
#
Take screenshot
browser-use close
#
Close browser
The CLI keeps the browser running between commands for fast iteration. See
CLI docs
for all commands.

FAQ
What's the best model to use?
We optimized
ChatBrowserUse()
specifically for browser automation tasks. On avg it completes tasks 3-5x faster than other models with SOTA accuracy.
Pricing (per 1M tokens):
Input tokens: $0.20
Cached input tokens: $0.02
Output tokens: $2.00
For other LLM providers, see our
supported models documentation
.
Should I use the Browser Use system prompt with the open-source preview model?
Yes. If you use
ChatBrowserUse(model='browser-use/bu-30b-a3b-preview')
with a normal
Agent(...)
, Browser Use still sends its default agent system prompt for you.
You do
not
need to add a separate custom "Browser Use system message" just because you switched to the open-source preview model. Only use
extend_system_message
or
override_system_message
when you intentionally want to customize the default behavior for your task.
If you want the best default speed/accuracy, we still recommend the newer hosted
bu-*
models. If you want the open-source preview model, the setup stays the same apart from the
model=
value.
Can I use custom tools with the agent?
Yes! You can add custom tools to extend the agent's capabilities:
from
browser_use
import
Tools
tools
=
Tools
()
@
tools
.
action
(
description
=
'Description of what this tool does.'
)
def
custom_tool
(
param
:
str
)
->
str
:
return
f"Result:
{
param
}
"
agent
=
Agent
(
task
=
"Your task"
,
llm
=
llm
,
browser
=
browser
,
tools
=
tools
,
)
Can I use this for free?
Yes! Browser-Use is open source and free to use. You only need to choose an LLM provider (like OpenAI, Google, ChatBrowserUse, or run local models with Ollama).

How do I handle authentication?
Check out our authentication examples:
Using real browser profiles
- Reuse your existing Chrome profile with saved logins
If you want to use temporary accounts with inbox, choose AgentMail
To sync your auth profile with the remote browser, run
curl -fsSL https://browser-use.com/profile.sh | BROWSER_USE_API_KEY=XXXX sh
(replace XXXX with your API key)
These examples show how to maintain sessions and handle authentication seamlessly.
How do I solve CAPTCHAs?
For CAPTCHA handling, you need better browser fingerprinting and proxies. Use
Browser Use Cloud
which provides stealth browsers designed to avoid detection and CAPTCHA challenges.
How do I go into production?
Chrome can consume a lot of memory, and running many agents in parallel can be tricky to manage.
For production use cases, use our
Browser Use Cloud API
which handles:
Scalable browser infrastructure
Memory management
Proxy rotation
Stealth browser fingerprinting
High-performance parallel execution
Tell your computer what to do, and it gets it done.
